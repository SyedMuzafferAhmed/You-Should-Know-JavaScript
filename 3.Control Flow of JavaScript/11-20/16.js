/*

One other possibility in a for loop is that you may want to skip execution of the nested
statements for just one condition. In other words, as the loop goes merrily on its way
round and round, executing statements for each value of the loop counter, one value of
that loop
To accomplish this task, the nested statements need to include an if construction to test
for the presence of the value to skip. When that value is reached, the continue command
tells JavaScript to immediately skip the rest of the body, execute the update statement,
and loop back around to the top of the loop.
