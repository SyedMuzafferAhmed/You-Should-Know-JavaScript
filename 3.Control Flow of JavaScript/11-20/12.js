/*
The basic syntax for a while loop is
while (condition) {
 //statements
}
The condition expression is the same kind that you saw in the middle parameter of the for
loop. You introduce this kind of loop if some condition exists in your code (evaluates to
true) before reaching this loop. The loop then performs some action, which affects that
condition repeatedly until that condition becomes false. At that point, the loop exits, and
script execution continues with statements after the closing brace. If the statements inside
the while loop do not somehow affect the values being tested in condition, your script
never exits, and it becomes stuck in an infinite loop.*/
