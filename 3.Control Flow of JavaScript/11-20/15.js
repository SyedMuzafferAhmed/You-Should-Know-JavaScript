/*

 Some loop constructions perform their job as soon as a certain condition is met, at which
point they have no further need to continue looping through the rest of the values in the
loop ĐouŶter’s range. A common scenario for this is the cycling of a loop through an entire
array in search of a single entry that matches some criterion. That criterion test is set up as
an if construction inside the loop. If that criterion is met, you break out of the loop and let
the script continue with the more meaningful processing of succeeding statements in the
main flow. To accomplish that exit from the loop, use the break statement.
The break statement breaks the loop and continues executing the code after the loop (if
any):
