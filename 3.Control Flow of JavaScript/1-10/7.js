/*

he JavaScript for loop repeats a series of statements any number of times
and includes an optional loop counter that can be used in the execution of the
statements.
The following is the formal syntax definition:

for ( [initial expression]; [condition]; [update expression]) {
//  statements
}

When the, for loop executes, the following occurs:
1. The initializing expression is executed. This expression usually initializes
one or more loop counters, but the syntax allows an expression of any
degree of complexity.
2. The condition expression is evaluated. If the value of condition is true, the
loop statements execute. If the value of condition is false, the for loop
terminates.
3. The update expression increment executes.
4. The statements execute, and control returns to step 2.
