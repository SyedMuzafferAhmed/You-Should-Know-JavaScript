/*
If/else statements allow an action to be carried out if a particular condition is
matched, else a different action will be carried out. So if an if/else statement is
placed within a loop, it’ll run each time the loop does.
The example below shows how the numbers printed from a counter for loop can
be manipulated. I want the loop to tell me which numbers are odd and which are
even; if the number is even, I want (even) to be printed after the number and if it
is odd, I want (odd) to be printed.
Here is the code that can accomplish this and the result – the loop is counting
from 1 to 10 and checking each time it is run to see if the variable value passed in
is divisible by 2 (if it is, it is an even number).
