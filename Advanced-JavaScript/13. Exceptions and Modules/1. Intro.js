/*
The try, catch and finally blocks are used to handle exceptions (a type of an error). Before you learn about them, you need to know about the types of errors in programming.

Types of Errors
In programming, there can be two types of errors in the code:

Syntax Error: Error in the syntax. For example, if you write consol.log('your result');, the above program throws a syntax error. The spelling of console is a mistake in the above code.

Runtime Error: This type of error occurs during the execution of the program. For example,
calling an invalid function or a variable.


These errors that occur during runtime are called exceptions. Now, let's see how you can handle these exceptions
